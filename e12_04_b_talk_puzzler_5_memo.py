# Exercise 12.4: Car Talk Puzzler V: Reducible Words!

"""My undertake with problem is to create a recursive memoized function
as Allen Downey recommends. However, I add the idea that the recursion
must be performed a first time over the whole set in an ordered manner,
first with the shorter words. Memoizing everithing. In case you want to
add words to the database/file, the memo database must be updated at
the same time. A new word is going to affect the memos of bigger words
not of the smaller.

If you add a new one or two letter word,
that is going to produce a huge change on the memos database.

The memoized version finds the reducible words and delivers its dictionary
in 0.16706013679504395 seconds, while the non-memoized version finish
the same task in almost the same amount of time: 0.1425168514251709
seconds. This is because of the shallow nature of the reduction graphs
that natural language produces.
