last person down at the dinner and flask is the first man
up consider for hereby flasks dinner was badly jammed in point of
time starbuck and stubb both had the start of him half a
league and the sea thereabouts being full of sharppointed rocks the monster
was not able to overtake the boat this i was afterwards told
for i durst not stay to see the issue of the adventure
but ran as fast as i could and hoped in a short
time i took all possible methods to cultivate this favourable disposition the
natives came by degrees to be less apprehensive of any danger from
me i would sometimes lie down and let five or six of
them dance on my hand and at last the boys and girls
would venture to come and play at hideandseek in my hair i
had now made a good progress in understanding and speaking the language
the emperor had a mind one day to entertain me with several
of the country shows wherein they exceed all nations i have known
both for dexterity and magnificence i was diverted with none so much
as that of the ropedancers performed upon a slender white thread extended
about two feet and twelve inches from the ground upon which i
shall desire liberty with the readers patience to enlarge a little this
diversion is only practised by those persons who are candidates for great
employments and high favour at court they are trained in this art
from their youth and are not always of noble birth or liberal
education when a great office is vacant either by death or disgrace
which often happens five or six of those candidates petition the emperor
to entertain his majesty and the court with a dance on the
rope and whoever jumps the highest without falling succeeds in the office
very often the chief ministers themselves are commanded to show their skill
and to convince the emperor that they have not lost their faculty
flimnap the treasurer is allowed to cut a caper on the straight
rope at least an inch higher than any other lord in the
whole empire i have seen him do the summerset several times together
upon a trencher fixed on a rope which is no thicker than
a common packthread in england my friend reldresal principal secretary for private
affairs who always approved himself your true friend was commanded by the
emperor to deliver his opinion which he accordingly did and therein justified
the good thoughts you have of him he allowed your crimes to
be great but that still there was room for mercy the most
commendable virtue in a prince and for which his majesty was so

a flash of the northern lights and the successive armed kings and
emperors dash by like a charge of crowned centaurs not wholly unworthy
of a place in that gallery are these sea battlepieces of garnery
the natural aptitude of the french for seizing the picturesqueness of things
seems to be peculiarly evinced in what paintings and engravings they have
of their whaling scenes with not one tenth of englands experience in
the fishery and not the thousandth part of that of the americans
they have nevertheless furnished both nations with the only finished sketches at
all capable of conveying the real spirit of the whale hunt for
the most part the commodore on the quarterdeck gets his atmosphere at
second hand from the sailors on the forecastle he thinks he breathes
it first but not so in much the same way do the
commonalty lead their leaders in many other things at the same time
that my birth was of the lower sort having been born of
plain honest parents who were just able to give me a tolerable
education that nobility among us was altogether a different thing from the
idea he had of it that our young noblemen are bred from
their childhood in idleness and luxury that as soon as years will
permit they consume their vigour and contract odious diseases among lewd females
and when their fortunes are almost ruined they marry some woman of
mean birth disagreeable person and unsound constitution merely for the sake of
injuring their fellowanimals neither could he comprehend what i meant in saying
they did it for hire whereupon i was at much pains to
make him understand that wine was not imported among us from foreign
countries to supply the want of water or other drinks but because
it was a sort of liquid which made us merry by putting
us out of our senses diverted all melancholy thoughts begat wild extravagant
imaginations in the brain raised our hopes and banished our fears suspended
every office of reason for a time and deprived us of the
use of our limbs till we fell into a profound sleep although
it must be confessed that his majesty gave many marks of his
great lenity often urging the services you had done him and endeavouring
to extenuate your crimes the treasurer and admiral insisted that you should
be put to death the prince knew nothing of what was going
on till one day when the kings chief huntsmen went ahunting with
him and they were alone in the wood together the huntsman looked
so sorrowful that the prince said my friend what is the matter
with the child hes got the brainfever as shore as youre born

in the open place before the log store cussing and yelling and
trying to get at a couple of young chaps that was behind

in daily hope of his sons return till at last the second
son said father i will go in search of the water of
life before me and never came back i have shut them up
by a charm between two mountains said the dwarf because they were
proud and illbehaved and scorned to ask advice the prince begged so
hard for his brothers that the dwarf at last set them free
though unwillingly saying beware of them for they have bad hearts their
brother however was greatly rejoiced to see them and told them all
that had happened and showed him the three branches and the golden
cup and the twelve princesses stood listening behind the door to hear
what he would say and when the king asked him where do
my twelve daughters dance at night he answered with twelve princes in
a castle under ground and then he told the king all that
had happened and showed him the three branches and the golden cup
and the twelve princesses stood listening behind the door to hear what
he would say and when the king asked him where do my
twelve daughters dance at night he answered with twelve princes in a

and said i love you far better than all the world so
come with me to my fathers palace and you shall be my
wife and snowdrop consented and went home with the prince and everything
was got ready with great pomp and splendour for their wedding to
the feast was asked among the rest snowdrops old enemy the queen
and as she was dressing herself in fine rich clothes she looked
in the glass and said tell me glass tell me true of
all the ladies in the land who is fairest tell me who
and the glass had always answered thou queen art the fairest of
all the fair and then her wicked heart was glad and as
happy as such a heart could be when evening came and the
dwarfs had gone home they found snowdrop lying on the ground no
breath came from her lips and they were afraid that she was
quite dead they lifted her up and when they found what these
yellow buttons were they took them all away and left her plenty

is deemed poisonous they try to evade it another thing i have
heard it said and i do not much doubt it that if
the jet is fairly spouted into your eyes it will blind you
the wisest thing the investigator can do then it seems to me
is to let this deadly spout alone still we can hypothesize even
if we cannot prove and establish my hypothesis is this that the
spout is nothing but mist and besides other reasons to this conclusion
i am impelled by considerations touching the great inherent dignity and sublimity
of the sperm whale i account him no common shallow being inasmuch
as it is an undisputed fact that he is never found on
soundings or near shores all other whales sometimes are he is both
ponderous and profound and i am convinced that from the heads of
all ponderous profound beings such as plato pyrrho the devil jupiter dante
and so on there always goes up a certain semivisible steam while
in the act of thinking deep thoughts while composing a little treatise
on eternity i had the curiosity to inquire in a particular manner
by what methods great numbers had procured to themselves high titles of
honour and prodigious estates and i confined my inquiry to a very
modern period however without grating upon present times because i would be
sure to give no offence even to foreigners for i hope the
reader need not be told that i do not in the least
intend my own country in what i say upon this occasion a
great number of persons concerned were called up and upon a very
slight examination discovered such a scene of infamy that i cannot reflect
upon it without some seriousness perjury oppression subornation fraud pandarism and the
like infirmities were among the most excusable arts they had to mention
and for these i gave as it was reasonable great allowance but
when some confessed they owed their greatness and wealth to sodomy or
incest others to the prostituting of their own wives and daughters others
to the betraying of their country or their prince some to poisoning
more to the perverting of justice in order to destroy the innocent
i hope i may be pardoned if these discoveries inclined me a
little to abate of that profound veneration which i am naturally apt
to pay to persons of high rank who ought to be treated
with the utmost respect due to their sublime dignity by us their
inferiors i had often read of some great services done to princes
and states and desired to see the persons by whom those services
were performed upon inquiry i was told that their names were to

re you alassin about says the baldhead to think i should have
lived to be leading such a life and be degraded down into
such company and he begun to wipe the corner of his eye
and so i knowed enough to talk on the right side i

about the english wilkses and so on but i didnt get pretty

i didnt care nothing for the compliment but i was glad to
be let off anyway the doctor he started to say something and
turns and says if youd been in town at first levi bell
the king broke in and reached out his hand and says why
is this my poor dead brothers old friend that hes wrote so
often about the lawyer and him shook hands and the lawyer smiled
and looked pleased and they talked right along awhile and then got
to one side and talked low and at last the lawyer speaks
up and says that ll fix it ill take the order and
send it along with your brothers and then theyll know its all
right so they got some paper and a pen and the king
he set down and twisted his head to one side he says
very low tramptramptramp thats the dead tramptramptramp theyre coming after me but
i wont go oh theyre here dont touch medont hands offtheyre cold
let go oh let a poor devil alone then he went down
on all fours and crawled off begging them to let him alone
and he rolled himself up in his blanket and wallowed in under
the old pine table still abegging and then he went to studying
by and by he said he would returnas soon as he felt
himself baptized again for the nonce however he proposed to sail about
and sow his wild oats in all four oceans they had made
a harpooneer of him and that barbed iron was in lieu of
a sceptre now i asked him what might be his immediate purpose
touching his future movements he answered to go to sea again in
his old vocation upon this i told him that whaling was my
own design and informed him of my intention to sail out of
nantucket as being the most promising port for an adventurous whaleman to
embark from he at once resolved to accompany me to that island

the conceit that because the socalled whalebone whales no longer haunt many
grounds in former years abounding with them hence that species also is
declining for they are only being driven from promontory to cape and
if one coast is no longer enlivened with their jets then be
sure some other and remoter strand has been very recently startled by
the unfamiliar spectacle furthermore concerning these last mentioned leviathans they have two
firm fortresses which in all human probability will for ever remain impregnable
and as upon the invasion of their valleys the frosty swiss have
retreated to their mountains so hunted from the savannas and glades of
the middle seas the whalebone whales can at last resort to their
polar citadels and diving under the ultimate glassy barriers and walls there
come up among icy fields and floes and in a charmed circle
of everlasting december bid defiance to all pursuit from man but as
perhaps fifty of these whalebone whales are harpooned for one cachalot some
philosophers of the forecastle have concluded that this positive havoc has already
very seriously diminished their battalions but though for some time past a
number of these whales not less than 13000 have been annually slain
on the nor west coast by the americans alone yet there are
considerations which render even this circumstance of little or no account as
an opposing argument in this matter natural as it is to be
somewhat incredulous concerning the populousness of the more enormous creatures of the
globe yet what shall we say to harto the historian of goa
when he tells us that at one hunting the king of siam
took 4000 elephants that in those regions elephants are numerous as droves
of cattle in the temperate climes and there seems no reason to
doubt that if these elephants which have now been hunted for thousands
of years by semiramis by porus by hannibal and by all the
successive monarchs of the eastif they still survive there in great numbers
much more may the great whale outlast all hunting since he has
a pasture to expatiate in which is precisely twice as large as
all asia both americas europe and africa new holland and all the
isles of the sea and vicargeneral of all oceanica the unflinching earnestness
with which he declared these thingsthe dark daring play of his sleepless
excited imagination and all the preternatural terrors of real delirium united to

way and rode so quickly that he did not even see what
the road was made of but went with his horse straight over
it and as he came to the wood he met the fox
and heard the same good counsel but he was thankful to the
fox and did not attempt his life as his brothers had done
so the fox said sit upon my tail and you will travel
faster so he sat down and the fox began to run and
away they went over stock and stone till their hair whistled again
as they came to the castle all was as the fox had
said and at twelve oclock the young man met the princess going
to the bath and gave her the kiss and she agreed to
run away with him but begged with many tears that he would
let her take leave of her father and mother then the fox
stretched out his tail and so away they went over stock and
stone till their hair whistled again as they came to the wood
where the fox first met them it was so cool and pleasant
that the two brothers said let us sit down by the side
of no river then away he went well thought the young man
it is no hard matter to keep that advice he rode on
with the princess till at last he came to the old tower
and opened the door of the little room in which briar rose
was and there she lay fast asleep on a couch by the
window she looked so beautiful that he could not take his eyes
off her so he stooped down and gave her a kiss but
the moment he kissed her she opened her eyes and awoke and
smiled upon him and they went out together and soon the king
and queen also awoke and all the court and gazed on each
other with great wonder and the horses shook themselves and the dogs
jumped up and barked the pigeons took their heads from under their
wings and looked about and flew into the fields the flies on

sat down the old woman then mixed a sleeping draught with their
wine and before long they were all lying on the floor of
the cellar fast asleep and snoring as soon as the girl was
assured of this she came from behind the cask she was obliged
to step over the bodies of the sleepers who were lying close
together and every moment she was filled with renewed dread lest she
should awaken them but god helped her so that she passed safely
over them and then she and the old woman went upstairs opened
the door and hastened as fast as they could from the murderers

to get their honey but the dwarf held them back and said
let the pretty insects enjoy themselves i cannot let you burn them

hundreds in the court sitting upon the ridge of a building holding
me like a baby in one of his forepaws and feeding me

them to the house i took the bag to where it used
to stand and ripped a hole in the bottom of it with
the saw for there warnt no knives and forks on the placepap
done everything with his claspknife about the cooking then i carried the
sack about a hundred yards across the grass and through the willows
east of the house to a shallow lake that was five mile
wide and full of rushesand ducks too you might say in the
season there was a slough or a creek leading out of it
on the other side that went miles away i dont know where
but it didnt go to the river the meal sifted out and
made a little track all the way to the lake i dropped
paps whetstone there too so as to look like it had been
done by accident then i tied up the rip in the meal
sack with a string so it wouldnt leak no more and took
it and my saw to the canoe again it was about dark
now so i dropped the canoe down the river under some willows
that hung over the bank and waited for the moon to rise
i made fast to a willow then i took a bite to
eat and by and by laid down in the canoe and cover
up with the quilt because if he set up people could tell
he was a nigger a good ways off i paddled over to

there he sat in great grief and fear not knowing what to
do now this rock belonged to fierce giants who lived upon it
and as he saw three of them striding about he thought to
himself i can eat salad it will refresh and strengthen me so
he picked out a fine head and ate of it but scarcely
had he swallowed two bites when he felt himself quite changed and
saw with horror that he was turned into an ass and ran
after the other letting the dish with the salad fall on the
ground the messenger sat all this time with the beautiful young lady
and as nobody came with the salad and she longed to taste
it she said i dont know where the salad can be then
he thought something must have happened and said i will go into
the kitchen and see and as he went he saw two asses
in the court running about and the salad lying on the ground
all right said he those two have had their share then he
took up the rest of the leaves laid them on the dish
and brought them to the young lady saying i bring you the
dish myself that you may not wait any longer so she ate
of it and like the others ran off into the court braying
away then the huntsman washed his face and went into the court
that they might know him now you shall be paid for your
roguery said he and tied them all three to a rope and
took them along with him till he came to a hill where
three giants were sharing their fathers goods and as they saw him
pass they cried out and said little men have sharp wits he
shall part the goods between us now there was a sword that
cut off an enemys head whenever the wearer gave the words heads
off a cloak that made the owner invisible or gave him any
form he pleased and a pair of boots that carried the wearer
wherever he wished heinel said they must first let him try these
wonderful things then he might know how to set a value upon
them then they gave him the cloak and he wished himself a
fly and in a moment he was standing in the boats stern
and the manilla men were springing to their oars in vain the
english captain hailed him with back to the stranger ship and face
set like a flint to his own ahab stood upright till alongside

for by some curious fatality as it is often noted of your
metropolitan freebooters that they ever encamp around the halls of justice so
sinners gentlemen most abound in holiest vicinities is that a friar passing
said don pedro looking downwards into the crowded plazza with humorous concern
well for our northern friend dame isabellas inquisition wanes in lima laughed
don sebastian proceed senor a moment pardon cried another of the company
in the name of all us limeese i but desire to express
to you sir sailor that we have by no means overlooked your
delicacy in not substituting present lima for distant venice in your corrupt
comparison oh do not bow and look surprised you know the proverb
all along this coastcorrupt as lima it but bears out your saying
too churches more plentiful than billiardtables and for ever openand corrupt as

i refill now you pour out again freely depicted in his own
vocation gentlemen the canaller would make a fine dramatic hero so abundantly
and picturesquely wicked is he like mark antony for days and days
along his greenturfed flowery nile he indolently floats openly toying with his
redcheeked cleopatra ripening his apricot thigh upon the sunny deck but ashore
all this effeminacy is dashed the brigandish guise which the canaller so
proudly sports his slouched and gailyribboned hat betoken his grand features a
terror to the smiling innocence of the villages through which he floats
his swart visage and bold swagger are not unshunned in cities once
a vagabond on his own canal i have received good turns from
one of these canallers i thank him heartily would fain be not
ungrateful but it is often one of the prime redeeming qualities of
your man of violence that at times he has as stiff an
arm to back a poor stranger in a strait as to plunder
a wealthy one in sum gentlemen what the wildness of this canal
life is is emphatically evinced by this that our wild whalefishery contains
so many of its most finished graduates and that scarce any race
of mankind except sydney men are so much distrusted by our whaling
captains nor does it at all diminish the curiousness of this matter
that to many thousands of our rural boys and young men born
along its line the probationary life of the grand canal furnishes the
sole transition between quietly reaping in a christian cornfield and recklessly ploughing
the waters of the most barbaric seas i see i see impetuously

lilliput the complexion of those diminutive people appeared to me the fairest
in the world and talking upon this subject with a person of
learning there who was an intimate friend of mine in lilliput took
the freedom in a warm day when i had used a good
deal of exercise to complain of a strong smell about me although
i am as little faulty that way as most of my sex
but i suppose his faculty of smelling was as nice with regard
to me as mine was to that of this people upon this
point i cannot forbear doing justice to the queen my mistress and
glumdalclitch my nurse whose persons were as sweet as those of any
lady in england that which gave me most uneasiness among these maids
of honour a pleasant frolicsome girl of sixteen would sometimes set me
astride upon one of her nipples with many other tricks wherein the
reader will excuse me for not being over particular but i was
so much displeased that i entreated glumdalclitch to contrive some excuse for
not seeing that young lady any more one day a young gentleman
who was nephew to my nurses governess came and pressed them both
to see an execution it was of a man who had murdered
one of that gentlemans intimate acquaintance glumdalclitch was prevailed on to be
of the company very much against her inclination for she was naturally
tenderhearted and as for myself although i abhorred such kind of spectacles
yet my curiosity tempted me to see something that i thought must
be extraordinary the malefactor was fixed in a chair upon a scaffold
erected for that purpose and his head cut off at one blow
with a sword of about forty feet long the veins and arteries
spouted up such a prodigious quantity of blood and so high in
the air that i trembled every limb but his father snatched me
from him and at the same time a right whales on the
larboard did you never hear stubb that that ship can never afterwards
capsize why not i dont know but i will but who in
the dingnations agoing to pay for it do you reckon your pap

the thought and joined the party soon afterwards as they were passing
by a farmyard they saw a cock perched upon a gate and
screaming out with all his might and so tight he couldnt walk
and couldnt do nothing to them the duke he begun to abuse
him for an old fool and the king begun to sass back
and the minute they was fairly at it i lit out and
shook the reefs out of my hind legs and spun down the
river road like a deer for i see our chance and i
made up my mind i wouldnt ever take aholt of a snakeskin
again with my hands now that i see what had come of
it jim said he reckoned the widow was partly right and pap
was partly right so the best way would be for us to
pick out two or three things from the list and say we
wouldnt borrow them any morethen he reckoned it wouldnt be no harm
to borrow the others so we talked it over all one night
drifting along down the river trying to make up our minds whether
to drop the watermelons or the cantelopes or the mushmelons or what
but towards daylight we got it all settled satisfactory and concluded to
drop crabapples and psimmons we warnt feeling just right before that but
it was all comfortable now i was glad the way it come
out too because crabapples aint ever good and the psimmons wouldnt be
ripe for two or three months yet we shot a waterfowl now
and then that got up too early in the morning or didnt
go to bed early enough in the evening take it all round
we lived pretty high the fifth night below st louis we had
a big storm after midnight with a power of thunder and lightning
and the rain poured down in a solid sheet we stayed in
the wigwam and let the raft take care of itself when the
lightning glared out we could see a big straight river ahead and
high rocky bluffs on both sides by and by says i hello
jim looky yonder it was a steamboat that had killed herself on
a rock we was drifting straight down for her the lightning showed
her very distinct she was leaning over with part of her upper
deck above water and you could see every little chimblyguy clean and
clear and a chair by the big bell with an old slouch
hat hanging on the back of it when the flashes come well
it being away in the night and stormy and all so mysteriouslike
i felt just the way any other boy would a felt when

doze i had blown out the candle and the mere thought of
queequegnot four feet offsitting there in that uneasy position stark alone in
the cold and dark this made me really wretched think of it
sleeping all night in the same room with a wide awake pagan
on his hams in this dreary unaccountable ramadan but somehow i dropped
off at last and knew nothing more till break of day when
looking over the bedside there squatted queequeg as if he had been
screwed down to the floor but as soon as the first rays
of the sun shone into the garden he saw all the ten
sacks standing side by side quite full and not a single grain
be wanting the youth sat down in the garden and considered how
it might be possible to perform this task but he could think
of nothing and there he sat sorrowfully awaiting the break of day
when he should be led to death but as soon as the
first rays of the sun shone into the garden he saw all
the ten sacks standing side by side quite full and not a
single grain was missing the antking had come in the night with
thousands and thousands of ants and the grateful creatures had by great
industry picked up all the milletseed and gathered them into the sacks
presently the kings daughter herself came down into the garden and strewed
with her own hands ten sacksful of milletseed on the grass then
she said tomorrow morning before sunrise these must be picked up and
not a single grain be wanting the youth sat down in the
garden and considered how it might be possible to perform this task
but he could think of nothing and there he sat sorrowfully awaiting
the break of day when he should be led to death but
as soon as the first rays of the sun shone into the
garden he saw all the ten sacks standing side by side quite
full and not a single grain was missing the antking had come
in the night before he went to look after them but they
were all off so he swore that he never again would take
