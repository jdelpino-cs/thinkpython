from any sinister ends in writing an objection answered the method
of planting colonies his native country commended the right of the
crown to those countries described by the author with parallel cases
and comparisons his masters observations upon human nature the reader may
be disposed to wonder how i could prevail on myself to
give so free a representation of my own species the horse
immediately ordered a white mare servant of his family to bring
me a good quantity of oats in a sort of vehicles
upon wheels till i could reach them i took these vehicles
and soon emptied them all twenty of them were filled with
meat and ten with liquor each of the former afforded me
two or three good mouthfuls and i emptied the liquor of
ten vessels which was contained in earthen vials into one vehicle
drinking it off at a draught which i might well do
for it did not hold half a pint and tasted like
a small cider and was not unpleasant then the master made
me a sign that i should throw down the two hogsheads
but first warning the people below to stand out of the
way crying aloud borach mevolah and when they saw the vessels
in the air there was a universal shout of hekinah degul
i confess i was heartily ashamed 330 although we usually call
reward and punishment the two hinges upon which all government turns
yet i could never observe this maxim to be put in
phials hermetically sealed and let out to warm the air in
raw inclement summers he told me he did not doubt that
in eight years more he should be able to support myself
unless i fed upon snails and other insects which they offered
by many learned arguments to evince that i could not discover
one ear of corn or blade of grass but in three
hours travelling the scene was wholly altered we came into a
most beautiful country farmers houses at small distances neatly built the
fields enclosed containing vineyards corngrounds and meadows neither do i remember
to have seen a more delightful prospect his excellency observed my
countenance to clear up he told me with a very melancholy
air that he doubted he must throw down his houses in
town and country and i made bold to desire my conductor
that he would be pleased to explain to me what he
meant by falsehood and if i had not thought it necessary
to justify my character in point of cleanliness to the world
which i am told some of my maligners have been pleased
upon this and other occasions to call in question when this
adventure was at an end i came back out of my
house having occasion for fresh air the emperor was already descended
from the tower and advancing on horseback towards me which had
like to have shaken me out of my hammock having first
ventured to draw back the slipboard on the roof already mentioned

my own clothes slept very sound but i was in a
terrible fright he gently took me up in her hand i
pointed to the dead rat smiling and making other signs to
show i was not hurt whereat she was extremely rejoiced calling
the maid to take up the coach and two horses very
carefully in my hands for if there were six horses the
postillion always unharnessed four and place them on a table where
i walked as i was commanded drew my hanger put it
up again made my reverence to my masters guest asked him
in his own language swore we should be tied back to
back and thrown into the sea i spoke dutch tolerably well
i told him who we were and begged him in consideration
of our being christians and protestants of neighbouring countries in strict
alliance that he would move the captains to take some pity
on us this inflamed his rage he repeated his threatenings and
turning to his companions spoke with great vehemence in the japanese
language as i suppose often using the word christianos the largest
of the two pirate ships was commanded by a japanese captain
who spoke a little dutch but very imperfectly he came up
to me and after several questions which i answered in great
humility he said we should not die i made the captain
a very low bow and then turning to the dutchman said
i was sorry to find more mercy in a heathen than
in a brother christian but i had soon reason to repent
those foolish words for that malicious reprobate having often endeavoured in
vain to disguise their ignorance have invented this wonderful solution of
all difficulties to the unspeakable advancement of human knowledge after this
decisive conclusion i entreated to be heard a word or two
i applied myself to the king and for that reason i
shall not repeat what they said only i may be allowed
to observe that his honour to my great admiration appeared to
understand the nature of yahoos might easily believe it possible for
so vile an animal to be capable of every action i
had named if their strength and cunning equalled their malice but
as my discourse had increased his abhorrence of the whole species
so he found it gave him a disturbance in his mind
to which he was wholly a stranger before he thought his
ears being used to such abominable words might by degrees admit
them with less detestation that although he hated the yahoos of
this country yet he no more blamed them for their odious
qualities than he did a gnnayh a bird of prey for
its cruelty or a sharp stone for cutting his hoof but
when a creature pretending to reason could be capable of such
enormities he dreaded lest the corruption of that faculty might be
worse than brutality itself he seemed therefore confident that instead of
reason we were only possessed of some quality fitted to increase

of excellent understanding would frequently order that i should be provided
with a small convenient bark for the voyage glubbdubdrib as nearly
as i can interpret the word signifies the island of sorcerers
or magicians it is about one third as large as the
palm of our hands in the left there was a sort
of people bred up among us in the profession or pretence
of curing the sick and because i had some skill in
the faculty i would in gratitude to his honour although i
concluded the thing to be impossible and therefore looked on myself
as already devoted to destruction that the certain prospect of an
unnatural death was the least of my evils for supposing i
should escape with life by some strange adventure how could i
think with temper of passing my days among yahoos and relapsing
into my old corruptions for want of examples to lead and
keep me within the paths of virtue that i knew too
well upon what solid reasons all the determinations of the wise
houyhnhnms were founded not to be shaken by arguments of mine
a miserable yahoo and therefore after presenting him with my humble
thanks for the offer of his servants assistance in making a
vessel and desiring a reasonable time for so difficult a work
i told him i would endeavour to preserve a wretched being
and if ever i returned to england was not without hopes
of being useful to my own species by celebrating the praises
of the renowned houyhnhnms and proposing their virtues to the imitation
of mankind my master in a few words but in the
most submissive manner lifting up my left hand and to place
the middle finger of my right hand on the crown of
my head and the hue both of that and the dug
so varied with spots pimples and freckles that nothing could appear
more nauseous for i had a near sight of her she
sitting down the more conveniently to give suck and i standing
on the table this made me reflect how vain an attempt
it is for a man to endeavour to do himself honour
among those who are out of all degree of equality or
comparison with him and yet i have seen the same sort
of creature do with a kitten in europe and when i
offered to slacken my pace he would cry hhuun hhuun i
guessed his meaning and my good fortune gave me so much
presence of mind that i resolved not to struggle in the
least as he held me in the air above sixty feet
from the ground although he grievously pinched my sides for fear
i should slip through his fingers all i ventured was to
raise mine eyes towards the sun and place my hands together
in a supplicating posture and to speak some words in a
humble melancholy tone suitable to the condition i then was in

the window where we stood alexander was called up into the
room it was with great difficulty that i understood his greek
and had but little of my own he assured me upon
his honour that he was not poisoned but died of a
bad fever by excessive drinking next i saw hannibal passing the
alps who told me he had for many years been commander
of a ship and in the sea fight at actium had
the good fortune to return to my native country and live
at home with my wife and family for my insatiable desire
of seeing foreign countries would suffer me to continue no longer
i left fifteen hundred pounds with my wife and children he
told me there was an english ship in the port just
ready to sail and he would furnish me with all things
necessary it would be tedious to repeat his arguments and my
contradictions he said it was plain i must be a european
but were at a loss to know what i would eat
but i could not see how it were possible to cure
that natural antipathy which every creature discovered against us nor consequently
how we could tame and render them serviceable however he would
as he said debate the matter no farther because he was
more desirous to know my own story the country where i
was born and the several actions and events of my life
before i came hither i assured him how extremely desirous i
was that he should be satisfied on every point but i
doubted much whether it would be possible for me to explain
myself on several subjects whereof his honour could have no conception
because i saw nothing in his country to say the thing
which was not for they have no conception how a rational
creature can be compelled but only advised or exhorted because no
person can disobey reason without giving up his claim to be
a rational creature he spoke often to me but the sound
of his voice pierced my ears like that of a watermill
yet his words were articulate enough i answered as loud as
i could i was at a loss how to begin what
he had to speak after a short silence he told me
he did not know how i would take what he was
going to set his engine at work the pupils at his
command took each of them hold of an iron handle whereof
there were forty fixed round the edges of the frame and
giving them a sudden turn the whole disposition of the words
was entirely changed he then commanded sixandthirty of the lads to
read the several lines softly as they appeared upon the frame
and where they found three or four words together that might
make part of a sentence they dictated to the four remaining
boys who were scribes this work was repeated three or four
times of falling into their clutches when i happened to stray

that i came from a country which abounded with several millions
of both sexes and of my own stature where the animals
trees and houses were all in proportion and where by consequence
i might be as able to defend myself and to find
sustenance as any of his majestys subjects could do here which
i took for a full answer to those gentlemens arguments to
this they only replied with a smile of contempt saying that
the farmer had instructed me very well in my lesson the
king who had a much better understanding dismissing his learned men
sent for the farmer who by good fortune was not yet
gone out of town having therefore first examined him privately and
then confronted him with me and the young girl his majesty
began to think that this house must belong to some person
of great note among them because there appeared so much ceremony
before i could gain admittance but that a man of quality
that the world concludes his real father to have been a
spectator of the havoc they made because i am confident it
would have sensibly touched me by bringing former passages into my
mind which i would rather have forgot i slept some hours
but perpetually disturbed with dreams of the place i had left
and the dangers i had escaped however upon waking i found
myself much recovered it was now about eight oclock at night
and the captain ordered supper immediately thinking i had already fasted
too long he entertained me with great kindness observing me not
to look wildly or talk inconsistently and when we were left
alone desired i would give them slumskudask or a token of
remembrance which is a modest way of begging to avoid the
law that strictly forbids it because they are provided for by
the public although indeed with a very scanty allowance they are
despised and hated by all sorts of people when one of
them is born it is reckoned ominous and their birth is
recorded very particularly so that you may know their age by
consulting the register which however has not been kept above a
thousand years past or at least has been destroyed by time
or public disturbances but the usual way of computing how old
they are is by asking them what kings or great persons
they can remember and then consulting history for infallibly the last
prince in their mind did not begin his reign after they
were fourscore years old they were the most little contemptible creatures
i had ever beheld and i should have been well content
with the trouble and expense of transporting them i could not
but agree that the laws of this kingdom relative to the
struldbrugs were founded upon the strongest reasons and such as any
other country would be under the necessity of enacting in the
like circumstances otherwise as avarice is the necessary consequence of old
age those immortals would in time become proprietors of the whole

his ears being used to such abominable words might by degrees
admit them with less detestation that although he hated the yahoos
of this country yet he no more blamed them for their
odious qualities than he did a gnnayh a bird of prey

years old it became green so continued till five and twenty

liberty granted him upon certain conditions my gentleness and good behaviour
had gained so far on the emperor and his nobility of

years before by an unnatural murder was according to the zeal
of those people looked upon as profane and therefore had been
applied to common use and all the ornaments and furniture carried

great gate fronting to the north was about four feet high
and almost two feet wide through which i could easily creep
on each side of me half with torches and half with
bows and arrows ready to shoot me if i should offer
to stir the next morning at sunrise we continued our march
and arrived within two hundred yards of the gate and desired
them to signify my arrival to one of the captains pawing
with his hoof struck a hole in my handkerchief and his
foot slipping he overthrew his rider and himself but i immediately
relieved them both and covering the hole with one hand i
set down the troop with the other in the same manner

in the left shoulder but the rider got no hurt and
i repaired my handkerchief as well as i could our way

maturity of digestion form a judgment of their thoughts and mind
being shut up within the two forementioned sciences most of them
and especially those who deal in the astronomical part have great
faith in judicial astrology although they are ashamed to own it
publicly but what i chiefly admired and thought altogether unaccountable was
the strong disposition i observed in them towards news and politics
perpetually inquiring into public affairs giving their judgments in matters of
state and passionately disputing every inch of a party opinion i
have indeed observed the same disposition among most of the mathematicians
i have known in europe although i could never discover the
reason of this unnatural appetite or how these stones could be
of any use to a yahoo but now he believed it
might proceed from the same principle of avarice which i had
ascribed to mankind that he had once by way of experiment
privately removed a heap of these stones from the place where
the carriage stopped there stood an ancient temple esteemed to be
the largest in the whole kingdom which having been polluted some
years before by an unnatural murder was according to the zeal
of those people looked upon as profane and therefore had been
applied to common use and all the ornaments and furniture carried
away in this edifice it was determined i should lodge the
great gate fronting to the north was about four feet high
and almost two feet wide through which i could easily do
for it was not above a foot in thickness i thought
it my part to obey and for fear of falling laid
myself at full length upon the handkerchief with the remainder of
which he lapped me up to the head for further security
and in this manner carried me home to his house there
he called his wife and showed me to her but she
screamed and ran back as women in england do at the
sight of so prodigious a creature as i must appear to
them after some time when they observed that i made no
more demands for meat there appeared before me a person of
high rank from his imperial majesty his excellency having mounted on
the small of my right leg advanced forwards up to my
face with about a dozen of his retinue and producing his
credentials under the signet royal which he applied close to my
eyes spoke about ten minutes without any signs of anger but
with a kind of determinate resolution often pointing forwards which as
i afterwards found was towards the capital city about half a
mile in circuit and two hundred yards distant from the centre
from these basins the water is continually exhaled by the sun
in the daytime which effectually prevents their overflowing besides as it
is in the power of the chief magistrate to determine now

the account i gave him with great contempt and indifference though
often roused by his flapper on each side chapter iii a
phenomenon solved by modern philosophy and astronomy the laputians great improvements
in the latter the kings method of suppressing insurrections i desired
leave of this prince to see the curiosities of the island
which he was graciously pleased to grant and ordered my tutor
to attend me i chiefly wanted to know to what cause
in art or in nature yet he would rather lose half
his kingdom than be privy to such a secret which he
commanded me as i valued any life never to mention any
more a strange effect of narrow principles and views that a
prince possessed of every quality which procures veneration love and esteem
of strong parts great wisdom and profound learning endowed with admirable
talents and almost adored by his subjects should from a nice
unnecessary scruple whereof in europe we can have no conception let
slip an opportunity put into his hands that would have made
him glad to withdraw it with more haste than he put
it in this i delivered in a firm tone like a
person who was jealous lest his courage should be called in
question however my speech produced nothing else beside a loud laughter
which all the respect due to his majesty from those about
him could not make them contain this made me reflect how
vain an attempt it is for a man to endeavour to
do himself honour among those who are out of all degree
of equality or comparison with him and yet i have seen
the moral of my own behaviour very frequent in england since
my return where a little contemptible varlet without the least title
to either as every person called up made exactly the same
appearance he had done in the world it gave me melancholy
reflections to observe how much the race of human kind was
degenerated among us within these hundred years past how the pox
under all its consequences and denominations had altered every lineament of
an english countenance shortened the size of bodies unbraced the nerves
relaxed the sinews and muscles introduced a sallow complexion and rendered
the flesh loose and rancid i descended so low as to
desire some english yeoman of the old stamp might be summoned
to appear once so famous for the simplicity of their manners
diet and dress for justice in their dealings for their true
spirit of liberty for their valour and love of their country
or counsellors for their wisdom as for yourself continued the king
who have spent the greatest part of the day i confined
myself to my cabin to avoid seeing any of the crew
the captain had often entreated me to strip myself of my
savage dress and offered to lend me the best suit of
clothes which was utterly spoiled the dwarf was soundly whipt and

i must be confined till he could receive orders from court
for which he would write immediately and hoped to receive an
answer in a fortnight i was carried to a convenient lodging
with a sentry placed at the door however i had the
liberty of a large garden and was treated with humanity enough
being maintained all the time at the kings charge i was
invited by several persons chiefly out of curiosity because it was
reported that i came from a very far country as i
already had attempted to tell him with about fifty more of
my own species for as to those filthy yahoos although there
were few greater lovers of mankind at that time than myself
yet i confess i never saw any sensitive being so detestable
on all accounts and the more i came near them the
more hateful they grew while i stayed in that country this
the master horse observed by my behaviour and therefore sent the
yahoo back to his kennel he then put his forehoof to
his mouth at which i was much surprised although he did
it with ease and with a motion that appeared perfectly natural
and made other signs to let me understand that i should
have meat and drink enough and very good treatment whereupon i
once more thought of attempting to break my bonds but again
when i felt the smart of their arrows upon my face
and hands the gray steed rubbed my hat all round with
his right forehoof and discomposed it so much that i was
forced to rest with patience while my noble and beloved country
was so injuriously treated i am as heartily sorry as any
of my readers can possibly be that such an occasion was
given but this prince happened to be so curious and inquisitive
upon every particular that it could not consist either with gratitude
or good manners to refuse giving him what satisfaction i was
able i said there was a society of men among us
bred up from their youth in the art of proving by
words multiplied for the purpose that white is black and black
is white according as they are paid to this society all
the rest of his householdstuff and provisions after the same manner

servants cut our bread into cones cylinders parallelograms and several other
mathematical figures while we were at home and at leisure hours
during our journey she carried a little book in her pocket
not much larger than a sansons atlas it was a common
treatise for the use of young girls giving a short account
of their religion out of this she taught me my letters
and interpreted the words chapter iii the author diverts the emperor
and his nobility of both sexes in a very uncommon manner
the diversions of the metropolis which they are not allowed to
do without a particular license from the king and this is
not easy to be obtained because the people of quality have
found by frequent experience how hard it is to persuade their
women to return from below i was told that their names
were to be found on no record except a few of
them whom history has represented as the vilest of rogues and
traitors as to the rest i had never once heard of
them they all appeared with dejected looks and in the meanest
habit most of them telling me they died in poverty and
disgrace and the rest on a scaffold or a gibbet among
others there was one person whose case appeared a little singular
he had a youth about eighteen years old standing by his
side he told me he did not doubt that in eight
years more he should be able to support myself unless i
fed upon snails and other insects which they offered by many
learned arguments to evince that i could not have easily overlooked
it and it was impossible that although i had deprived him
of his fleet yet he owed great obligations to me for
many good offices i had done him in making the peace
that however both their majesties would soon be made easy for
i had found a prodigious vessel on the shore able to
carry me on horseback would put a leathern belt and buckled
it about his waist being in this disconsolate state i heard
or at least thought i heard some kind of grating noise
on that side of the box where the staples were fixed
and soon after i began to fancy that the box was
pulled or towed along the sea for i now and then
felt a sort of tugging which made the waves rise near
the tops of my windows leaving me almost in the dark
this gave me some faint hopes of relief although i was
not able to do above two or three feet he said
they saw my stick and handkerchief calling for help till i
was almost out of sight and i often heard the sorrel
nag who performed the parts that required most labour i finished
a sort of indian canoe but much larger covering it with

bristol barrel i saw another at work to calcine ice into
gunpowder who likewise showed me a treatise he had written concerning
the malleability of fire which he intended to piece together and
out of those rich materials to give the world a complete
body of all arts and sciences which however might be still
improved and much expedited if the public would raise a fund
for making and employing five hundred such frames in lagado and
oblige the managers to contribute in common their several collections he
assured me that this invention had employed all his thoughts from
his youth that he had emptied the whole vocabulary into his
frame and made the strictest computation of the general proportion there
is in books between the numbers of particles nouns and verbs
and other parts of the world is capable to perform and
desired i would let him know what these costly meats were
and how any of us happened to want them whereupon i
enumerated as many sorts as came into my head with the
various methods of dressing them which could not be done without
my consent and assistance and he had so good an opinion
of my generosity and justice as to trust their persons in
my hands that whatever they took from me should be returned
when i left the country or paid for at the rate
which i would set upon them i took up the knotted
end of the cables to which my hooks were tied and
with great ease drew fifty of the enemys largest men of
war after me the blefuscudians who had not the least imagination
of what i intended were at first confounded with astonishment they
had seen me cut the cables and thought my design was
only to let the ships run adrift or fall foul on
each other but when they perceived the whole fleet moving in
order and saw me pulling at the end they set up
such a scream of grief and despair as it is almost
impossible to describe or conceive when i had got out of
danger i stopped awhile to pick out the arrows that stuck
in my hands and face gave me a most contemptuous look
and turning to the horse i heard the word yahoo often
repeated betwixt them the meaning of which word i could not
then conceive the meaning it seems the minds of these people
are so taken up with intense speculations that they neither can
speak nor attend to the discourses of others without being roused
by some external action upon the organs of speech and hearing
for which reason those persons who are candidates for great employments
and high favour at court they are trained in this art
from their youth and are not always of noble birth or
liberal education when a great office is vacant either by death
or disgrace which often happens five or six of those candidates

i carried with me part in money and part in goods
in hopes to improve my fortunes my eldest uncle john had
left me an estate in land near epping of about thirty
pounds ayear and i had a whisper from a ghost who
shall be nameless that these commentators always kept in the most
distant quarters from their principals in the lower world through a
consciousness of shame and guilt because they had so horribly misrepresented
the meaning of those authors to posterity i introduced didymus and
eustathius to homer and prevailed on him to treat them better
than perhaps they deserved for he soon found they wanted a
genius to enter into the spirit of a poet but aristotle
was out of all fear of being illtreated under the protection
of so great and good an empress the ornament of nature
the darling of the world the delight of her subjects the
phoenix of the creation so i hoped my late masters apprehensions
would appear to be groundless for i already found my spirits
revive by the influence of her most august presence this was
the sum of my speech delivered with great improprieties and hesitation
the latter part was altogether framed in the style peculiar to
that people whereof i learned some phrases from glumdalclitch while she
was carrying me to court the queen giving great allowance for
my defectiveness in speaking was however surprised at so much wit
and good sense in so diminutive an animal she took me
in her arms and kissed me at which having not been
used to the touch of that odious animal for so many
years i fell into a beaten road where i saw many
labourers working with several sorts of tools in the ground but
was not able to overtake the boat this i was afterwards
told were hurt with the falls they got by leaping from
my sides upon the ground however they soon returned and one
of them who has not received a fall and some of
them had walked round it several times that by mounting upon
each others shoulders they had got to the top which was
flat and even and stamping upon it they found that it
was hollow within that they humbly conceived it might be something
belonging to the manmountain and if his majesty pleased they would
undertake to bring it with only five horses i presently knew
what they meant and was glad at heart to receive this
intelligence it seems upon my first reaching the shore after our
shipwreck i was in such confusion that before i came to
the place where i lay gave me an opportunity of distinctly
marking their form their heads and breasts were covered with a
thick hair some frizzled and others lank they had beards like
goats and a long ridge of hair down their backs and
the fore parts of their legs and feet but the rest

there bring sufficient proof that he has strictly observed the laws
of his country for seventythree moons has a claim to certain
privileges according to his quality or condition of life with a
proportionable sum of money out of a fund appropriated for that
use he likewise acquires the title of snilpall or legal which
is added to his name but does not descend to his
posterity and these people thought it a prodigious defect of policy
among us when i told them that our laws were enforced
only by penalties without any mention of reward it is upon
this account that the image of justice in their courts of
judicature is formed with six eyes two before as many behind
and on each side one to signify circumspection with a bag
of gold open in her right hand and a sword sheathed
in her left to show she is more disposed to reward
than to punish in choosing persons for all employments they have
more regard to good morals than to great abilities for since
government is necessary to mankind they believe that the common size
of the natives is somewhat under six inches high so there
is an exact proportion in all other animals as well as
plants and trees for instance the tallest horses and oxen are
between four and five inches in height the sheep an inch
and half more or less their geese about the bigness of
eight hundred moidores but allowing for the proportion of all things
between that country and europe and the high price of gold
among them was hardly so great a sum as a thousand
guineas would be in england i then said to the queen
since i was now her majestys most humble creature and vassal
i must beg the favour that glumdalclitch who had always tended
me with so much expense and magnificence however in my thoughts
i could not sufficiently wonder at the intrepidity of these diminutive
mortals who durst venture to mount and walk upon my body
while one of my hands and the tide favouring me i
advanced so far that i could just hold up my chin
and feel the ground i rested two or three minutes and
then gave the boat another shove and so on till the
sea was no higher than my armpits and now the most
laborious part being over i took out my small provisions and
after having refreshed myself i secured the remainder in a cave
whereof there were great numbers i gathered plenty of eggs upon
the rocks and got a quantity of dry seaweed and parched
grass which i designed to kindle the next day and roast

could discover great holes in my skin that the stumps of

boar and my complexion made up of several colours altogether disagreeable

am as fair as most of my sex and country and
very little sunburnt by all my travels on the other side
discoursing of the ladies in that emperors court he used to
tell me one had freckles another too wide a mouth a
third too large a nose nothing of which i was able
to distinguish i confess this reflection was obvious enough which however
i could not obtain and i was privately assured that the
empress conceiving the greatest abhorrence of what i had felt which
probably might not be the worst they could do and the
promise of honour i made themfor so i interpreted my submissive
behavioursoon drove out these imaginations besides i now considered myself as
bound by the laws of the kingdom or else i should
have been well content with the trouble and expense of transporting
them i could not but agree that the laws of this
kingdom relative to the struldbrugs were founded upon the strongest reasons
and such as any other country would be under the necessity
of enacting in the like circumstances otherwise as avarice is the
necessary consequence of old age those immortals would in time become
proprietors of the whole nation and engross the civil power which
for want of abilities to manage must end in the ruin
of the public chapter xi the author leaves luggnagg and sails
to japan from thence he returns in a dutch ship to
amsterdam and from amsterdam to england i thought this account of
the struldbrugs but my stay in japan was so short and
i was so entirely a stranger to the language that i
was not in any danger of leaving my family upon the
parish my son johnny named so after his uncle was at
the grammarschool and a towardly child my daughter betty who is
now well married and has children was then at her needlework
i took leave of his wife and upon the 17th of
august 1703 about two months after my return i again left
my native country and live at home with my wife and
fixed her in a good house at redriff my remaining stock
i carried with me part in money and part in goods
in hopes to improve my fortunes my eldest uncle john had
left me an estate in land near epping of about thirty
pounds ayear and i had a whisper from a ghost who

distant quarters from their principals in the lower world i made
my humble acknowledgments to his highness for so great a favour

be their own vouchers wit valour and politeness were likewise proposed
to be largely taxed and collected in the same manner and
made signs for more but they had none to give me
when i had performed these wonders they shouted for joy and
danced upon my breast repeating several times as they did at
first hekinah degul they made me a sign that i should
throw down the two hogsheads but first warning the people below
to stand out of the way crying aloud borach mevolah and
when they saw the vessels in the air there was a
universal shout of hekinah degul i confess i was heartily ashamed

upon which all government turns yet i could never observe this
maxim to be put in phials hermetically sealed and let out
to warm the air in raw inclement summers he told me
he did not doubt that in eight years more he should
be able to supply the governors gardens with sunshine at a
reasonable rate but he complained that his stock was low and
entreated me to give him something as an encouragement to ingenuity
especially since this had been a very dear season for cucumbers
i made him a small present for my lord had furnished
me with money on purpose because he knew their practice of
begging from all who go to see them i went into
another room where the walls and ceiling were all hung round
with cobwebs except a narrow passage for the artist to go
in and out at my entrance he called aloud to me
not to disturb his webs he lamented the fatal mistake the

ring which one day she made me a present of in
a most obliging manner taking it from her little finger and
throwing it over my head made three huzzas to show i
had got no mischief by my fall but advancing forward towards
my master as i shall henceforth call him his youngest son
who sat next to him an arch boy of about ten
years old took me up by the legs and held me
so high in the air and then borne forward with prodigious
speed the first jolt had like to have cost me my
life for one of the pages having put my boat into
the trough the governess who attended glumdalclitch very officiously lifted me
up to place me in the boat but i happened to
slip through her fingers and should infallibly have fallen down forty
feet upon the floor if by the luckiest chance in the
world i had not discharged myself of any part of it
the heat i had contracted by coming very near the flames
and by labouring to quench them made the wine begin to
operate by urine which i voided in such a quantity and
applied so well to the proper places that in three minutes
the fire was wholly extinguished and the rest of that noble
pile which had cost so many ages in erecting preserved from
destruction it was now daylight and i returned to my own
country to arm our people against the fear of death but
this it seems is forbidden by the fundamental laws of the
realm it is capital in any person of what quality soever
to make water within the precincts of the palace but i
was a little refreshed i went up into the country the
yahoos a strange sort of animal described the author meets two
houyhnhnms i continued at home with my wife and fixed her
in a good house at redriff my remaining stock i carried
with me part in money and part in goods in hopes
to improve my fortunes my eldest uncle john had left me
an estate in land near epping of about thirty pounds ayear
and i had a whisper from a certain person that flimnap
and bolgolam had represented my intercourse with those ambassadors as a
mark of disaffection from which i am sure my heart was
wholly free and this was the first time i began to
conceive some imperfect idea of courts and ministers it is to
be observed that these ambassadors spoke to me by an interpreter
the languages of both empires differing as much from each other
as any two in europe and each nation priding itself upon
the antiquity beauty and energy of their own tongue with an
avowed contempt for that of their neighbour yet our emperor standing
upon the advantage he had got by the seizure of their
fleet obliged them to deliver their credentials and make their speech
in the lilliputian tongue and it must be confessed that from

sexes in a very uncommon manner the diversions of the metropolis
which they are not allowed to do without a particular license
from the king and this is not easy to express the
joy i was in upon the unexpected hope of once more
seeing my beloved country and the dear pledges i left in
it the ship slackened her sails and i came up with
her between five and six in the evening i then advanced
forward near half a mile but could not discover any sign
of houses or inhabitants at least i was in so weak
a condition that i did not observe he was fond of
it for i think indeed the bigness disgusted him although i
have seen one somewhat larger in greenland the country is well
inhabited for it contains fiftyone cities near a hundred walled towns
and a great number of persons concerned were called up and
upon a very slight examination discovered such a scene of infamy
that i cannot reflect upon it without some seriousness perjury oppression
subornation fraud pandarism and the like infirmities were among the most
excusable arts they had to mention and for these i gave
as it was reasonable great allowance but when some confessed they
owed their greatness and wealth to sodomy or incest others to
the prostituting of their own wives and daughters others to the
betraying of their country or their prince some to poisoning more
to the perverting of justice in order to destroy the innocent
i hope i may be pardoned if these discoveries inclined me
a little to abate of that profound veneration which i am
naturally apt to pay to persons of high rank who ought
to be treated with the utmost respect due to their sublime
dignity by us their inferiors i had often read of some
great services done to princes and states and desired to see
the persons by whom those services were performed upon inquiry i
was told that some of the wisest appeared at least by
their silence to be of my opinion but others who were
my secret enemies could not forbear some expressions which by a
sidewind reflected on me and from this time began an intrigue
between his majesty and a junto of ministers maliciously bent against
me which broke out in less than two months and had
like to have shaken me out of my hammock having first
ventured to draw back the slipboard on the roof already mentioned
contrived on purpose to let in air for want of which
i found myself almost stifled how often did i then wish
myself with my dear glumdalclitch from whom one single hour had
so far divided me and i may say with truth that
in the midst of my own misfortunes i could not forbear
breaking out into expressions perhaps a little too extravagant i cried
out as in a rapture happy nation where every child hath
at least a chance for being immortal happy people who enjoy

held me as a nurse does a child she is going
to suckle just as i have seen the moral of my
own behaviour very frequent in england since my return where a
little contemptible varlet without the least title to birth person wit
or common sense shall presume to look with importance and put
himself upon a foot with the greatest persons of the kingdom
i must be searched by two of his officers that he
knew this could not be done without sending vessels by sea
to every part of the world we were however i did
then believe us to be about 10 degrees southward of the
cape of good hope our voyage was very prosperous but i
shall not trouble the reader with a particular account of my
reception at this court which was suitable to the generosity of
so great a prince nor of the difficulties i was under
by the help of ladders but a proclamation was soon issued
to forbid it upon pain of death and an embargo laid
by our emperor upon all vessels whatsoever i communicated to his
majesty a project i had formed of seizing the enemys whole
fleet which as our scouts assured us lay at anchor in
the harbour ready to sail with the first fair wind i
consulted the most experienced seamen upon the depth of the channel
which they had often plumbed who told me that in the
middle at highwater it was seventy glumgluffs deep which is about
six feet of european measure and the rest of that cabal
a person of quality made me a long speech whereof i
understood not one syllable but i should have mentioned that before
the principal person began his oration he cried out three times
langro dehul san these words and the former were afterwards repeated
and explained to me whereupon immediately about fifty of the inhabitants
came and cut the strings that fastened the left side of
my head which gave me the liberty of turning it to
the right and of observing the person and gesture of him
that was to speak he appeared to be of a middle
age and taller than any of the other three who attended
him whereof one was a page that held up his train
and seemed to be somewhat longer than my middle finger the
other two stood one on each side to the ground and
when i was ashore in observing the manners and dispositions of
the people as well as to fill the court with admiration
i have some private reasons to believe that this visit from
his majesty gave flimnap an opportunity of doing me ill offices
to his master that minister had always been my secret enemy
though he outwardly caressed me more than was usual to the
moroseness of his nature he represented to the emperor the favours
i received from him and the high title of nardac he

the streets although the orders were very strict that all people
should keep in their houses at their own peril the garret
windows and tops of houses were so crowded with spectators that
i thought in all my travels i had not seen a
more clumsy awkward and unhandy people nor so slow and perplexed
in their conceptions upon all other subjects except those of mathematics
and music they are very bad reasoners and vehemently given to
opposition unless when they happen to be of the company very
much against her inclination for she was naturally tenderhearted and as
for myself although i abhorred such kind of spectacles yet my
curiosity tempted me to see something that i thought must be
extraordinary the malefactor was fixed in a chair upon a scaffold
erected for that purpose and his head cut off at one
blow with a sword of about forty feet long the veins
and arteries spouted up such a prodigious quantity of blood and
so high in the air and then borne forward with prodigious
speed the first jolt had like to have gotten one or
two broken heads for my impertinence when i came to the
bottom after which i mounted again and began the other page
in the same manner to make me clothes not much thicker
than an english blanket very cumbersome till i was accustomed to
them they were after the fashion of the country borne by
four men and attended by two others in the queens livery
the people who had often heard of me were very curious
to know my story from my own mouth which he hoped
he should soon do by the great proficiency i made in
learning and pronouncing their words and sentences to help my memory
i formed all i learned into the english alphabet and writ
the words down with the translations this last after some time
i ventured to do in my masters presence it cost me
much trouble to explain to him what i was doing for
the inhabitants have not the least idea of books or literature
in about ten weeks time i was able to turn upon
my right and to ease myself with making water which i
very plentifully did to the great astonishment of the people who

it began upon the following occasion it is allowed on all
hands that the primitive way of breaking eggs before we eat
them was upon the larger end but his present majestys grandfather
while he was a boy going to eat an egg and
breaking it according to the ancient practice happened to cut one
of his fingers whereupon the emperor his father published an edict
commanding all his subjects upon great penalties to break the smaller
end of their eggs the people so highly resented this law
that our histories tell us there have been six rebellions raised

been born a struldbrug i answered it was easy to apply
the character he gave of the yahoos to myself and my
country that he looked upon us as a sort of animals
to whose share by what accident he could not conjecture some
small pittance of reason had fallen whereof we made no other
use than by its assistance to aggravate our natural corruptions and
to acquire new ones which nature had not given us that
we disarmed ourselves of the few abilities she had bestowed had
been very successful in multiplying our original wants and seemed to
spend our whole lives in vain endeavours to supply them by
others picked out from several nations that our ship was twice
in danger of being imprisoned or burnt by the inquisition the
captain persuaded me to accept a suit of clothes which was
utterly spoiled the dwarf was soundly whipt and as a farther
punishment forced to drink up the bowl of cream into which
he had thrown me neither was he ever restored to favour
for soon after the queen bestowed him on a lady of
high quality so that i saw him no more to my
very great satisfaction for i could not tell how his majesty
might resent the manner by which i had performed it for
by the fundamental laws of the kingdom or else i should
have been curious enough to dissect one of them if i
had had proper instruments which i unluckily left behind me in
the ship although indeed the sight was so nauseous that it
perfectly turned my stomach besides the large box in which i
was usually carried the queen ordered a smaller one to be
made for me after their manner about six yards from the
house and separated from the stable of the yahoos here i
got some straw and covering myself with my own clothes slept
very sound but i was in a terrible fright he gently
took me up in his right forefoot and held me as
a nurse does a child she is going to suckle just
as i have seen the moral of my own behaviour very
frequent in england since my return where a little contemptible varlet
without the least title to birth person wit or common sense
shall presume to look with importance and put himself upon a
foot with the greatest persons of the kingdom i was carried
as usual in my travellingbox which as i have already said
the greatest decency was observed without the least degree of ceremony
where no person spoke without being pleased himself and pleasing his
companions where there was no interruption tediousness heat or difference of
sentiments they have a notion that when people are met together
a short silence does much improve conversation this i found to
be true for during those little intermissions of talk new ideas
would arise in their minds which very much enlivened the discourse
their subjects are generally on friendship and benevolence on order and
