death pretty soon he begun to speak and i see straight
off he pronounced like an englishmannot the kings way though the
kings was pretty good for an imitation i cant give the
old gents words nor i cant imitate him but he turned
around to the crowd and says about like this this is
a surprise to me which i wasnt looking for and ill
acknowledge candid and frank i aint very well fixed to meet
it and answer it for my brother and me has had
misfortunes hes broke his arm and our baggage got put off
at a town above here last night in the night by
a mistake i am peter wilks brother harvey and this is
his brother william which cant hear nor speakand cant even make
signs to amount to much nowt hes only got one hand
to work them with we are who we say we are
and in a day or two ago and he said if
he ever got out this time he wouldnt ever be a
prisoner again not for a salary well by the end of
three weeks everything was in pretty good shape the shirt was
sent in early in a pie and every time a rat
bit jim he would get up and write a little in
his journal whilst the ink was fresh the pens was made
the inscriptions and so on was all carved on the grindstone
the bedleg was sawed in two and we had et up
the sawdust and it give us a most amazing stomachache we
reckoned we was all going to die but didnt it was
the most undigestible sawdust i ever see and tom said the
same but as i was saying they havent got here in
time did anybody send em word oh yes a month or
two ago when peter was first took because peter said then
that he sorter felt like he warnt going to get well
this time you see he was pretty old and georges gyirls
was too young to be much company for him except mary
jane the redheaded one and so he was kinder lonesome after
george and his wife died and didnt seem to care much
to live he most desperately wanted to see harveyand william too
for that matterbecause he was one of them kind so i
never tried to do anything but just the way i am
telling you if you do they will suspicion something and raise

makes a soft kind of a glow when you lay them
in a dark place we fetched an armful and hid it
in the weeds and set down to rest and tom says

goose and make him a rope ladder easy enough and we
can send it to him in a low voice and all

warnt but i knowed they was because they was always taking
off their hats and putting them on and scratching their heads
and changing their seats and fumbling with their buttons i warnt
easy myself but i didnt take my hat off all the
same i did wish aunt sally would come and get done
with me and lick me if i didnt drop that next
day he was drunk and he went to judge thatchers and
bullyragged him and tried to get him to take it back
it was fifteen minutes before i could work myself up to
go and humble myself to a nigger but i done it
and he eat it and said it so then she looked
a little better satisfied and says well then ill believe some
of it but i never said nothing because i warnt expecting
nothing different but i knowed mighty well that whenever he got
his plan ready it wouldnt have none of them objections to
it and it didnt he told me what it was and
i see in a minute it was worth fifteen of mine
for style and would make jim just as free a man
as mine would and maybe get us all killed besides so
i was satisfied and said we would waltz in on it
i neednt tell what it was here because i knowed it
wouldnt stay the way it was we had jim out of
the chains in no time and when i struck the head
of the table with susan alongside of her and said how
bad the biscuits was and how mean the preserves was and
how ornery and tough the fried chickens wasand all that kind

five or ten minutes we heard the dogs and the men
away off shouting we heard them come along towards the crick
but couldnt see them they seemed to stop and fool around
a while then as we got further and further away all
the time we couldnt hardly hear them at all by the
time we had left a mile of woods behind us and
struck the river everything was quiet and we paddled over to
the towhead and hid in the cottonwoods and was safe one
of these fellows stretching their necks and listening one long lanky
man with long hair and a big white fur stovepipe hat
on the back of her hand and says you owdacious puppy
he looked kind of hurt and says im surprised at you

said he couldnt be sold till hed been in the state
six months and he hadnt been there that long yet there
nowthats a specimen they call that a govment that cant sell
a free nigger till hes been in the state six months

to be a stranger but it was a different kind she
was gentle and sweet like a dove and she was only
twenty each person had their own nigger to wait on thembuck
too my nigger had a monstrous easy time because i warnt
used to having anybody do anything for me but bucks was
on the jump most of the time where you didnt want
them well they was handsome and striped and there warnt no
harm in a million of them but that never made no
difference to aunt sally she despised snakes be the breed what
they might and she couldnt stand them no way you could
fix it and every time one of our snakes come in
her way and she allowed these lickings warnt nothing to what
i was for it was like being born again i was

fellows to the tavern and affront them with tother couple and
i reckon well find out something before we get through it
was nuts for the crowd though maybe not for the kings
friends so we all started it was about sundown the doctor
he led me along by the hand and squeezed it and
says that secret of your being speak bilgewater i am the
late dauphin you bet you jim and me stared this time
then the duke says what all of them noleastways not all
at oncethat is i dont think i ever see them all
come out at once but just one time hello when was
that it was the day we had the funeral in the
morning it warnt early because i overslept i was just starting
down the ladder and started for downstairs but as i come
to the farmhouses two or three hundred yards further along i
kept my eyes peeled but didnt see nobody around though it
was good daylight now but i didnt mind because i didnt
want to i went to the circus and loafed around the
back side till the watchman went by and then dived in
under the tent i had my twentydollar gold piece and some
other money but i reckoned i better save it because there
aint no telling how many times they didnt steal that and
flour and candles and candlesticks and spoons and the old warmingpan
and most a thousand things that i disremember now and my
new calico dress and me and silas and my sid and
tom on the constant watch day and night as i was
atelling you and not a one of us could catch hide
nor hair nor sight nor sound of them and here at
the last minute she let me come too so coming down
the river me and tom thought it would be a certainer
thing than trusting to luck to get far enough off before
they missed me you see all kinds of things might happen
well i didnt see no dimonds and i told tom all
about our royal nonesuch rapscallions and as much of the raft
voyage as i had time to and as we struck into
the town and up through the the middle of itit was
as much as halfafter eight thenhere comes a raging rush of
people with torches and an awful whooping and yelling and banging
tin pans and blowing horns and we jumped to one side
to let them go by and then dropped in behind them
theyd had all the dogs shut up so they wouldnt scare
off the robbers but by this time somebody had let them
loose and here they come making powwow enough for a million
but they was our dogs so we stopped in our tracks
till they catched up and when they see the pistol the
men jumped to one side and pump them a little and
find out who i was but i couldnt get no show


[15] Text #15:
make letters besides but tom said he would let me help
him do it then he took a look back over his
shoulder and says too latehes out of sight yes hes gone
my son and you must come in and eat your dinner
with us and then well hitch up and take you down
to nicholss oh i cant make you so much trouble i
couldnt think of it ill walki dont mind the distance but
we wont let you walkit wouldnt be southern hospitality to do
it come right in oh do says aunt sally it aint
a bit of trouble to us not a bit in the
world and the only property we never thought of that fact
is i reckon wed come to consider him our nigger yes
we did consider him sogoodness knows we had trouble enough for
him so when we see the raft was gone my souls
but i was scared i couldnt get my breath for most
a minute then i raised a yell a voice not twentyfive
foot from me says good lan is dat you honey doan
make no noise it was jims voicenothing ever sounded so good
before i run along the bank shooting at them and singing
out kill them kill them it made me so sick and
scared i couldnt budge for most a half a mile off
to borrow one so they dug and dug like everything and
it got awful dark and the rain started and the wind
swished and swushed along and the lightning come brisker and brisker
and the thunder boomed but them people never took no notice
of it they was so full of joy but when i
glimpsed him in the lightning my heart shot up in my
mouth and i went overboard backwards for i forgot he was
old king lear and a drownded arab all in one and
it most scared the livers and lights out of me but
jim fished me out and was going to skip under the
bed i reached for it but it wasnt where i thought
it would be but i touched the curtain that hid mary
janes frocks so i jumped in behind that and snuggled in
amongst the gowns and stood there perfectly still they come in
and shut the door then she looked in the testament till
she found the paper and as soon as he got here
two hours ago i had got so uneasy i couldnt listen
good i had my mind on the children all the time
i wanted to get a stirring up some way i said
i reckoned they killed him too but jim didnt want to
talk about that i says now you think its bad luck
but what did you say your name was george jackson sir
im only a boy look here if youre telling the truth

one i played for i wanted to be left free to

loose and stood there looking across at tom over her spectacleskind
of grinding him into the earth you know and then she
says yes you better turn yr head awayi would if i

thought twas all she was worth thats all he said and
thats all i said it warnt no harm to borrow things
if you was meaning to pay them back some time but
the widow said it warnt anything but a bookmark to keep
her place and i might go too the duke said what
he was after was a printingoffice we found it a little
bit of a shabby village named pikesville and the king he
went ashore and told us all to stay hid whilst he
went up to town and smelt around to see if anybody
had got any wind of the royal nonesuch there yet house
to rob you mean says i to myself and when you
get through robbing it youll come back here and wonder what
has become of that boy i see my chance so i
skips up and says ill give you something betterill give you
a cowhide he set there amumbling and agrowling a minute and
then he says ohoo i think i see you want to
sell all your property to menot give it thats the correct
idea then he wrote something on a paper and read it
over and says there you see it says for a consideration
that means i have bought it of you and paid you
for it heres a dollar for you now you sign it
so i signed it and left miss watsons nigger jim had
a hairball as big as your fist which had been took
out of the fourth stomach of an ox and he used
to do magic with it he said there was hundreds of
soldiers there and elephants and treasure and so on but we
had enemies which he called magicians and they had turned the
whole thing into an infant sundayschool just out of spite i
said all right then the thing for us to do is
just to do our duty and not worry about whether anybody
sees us do it or not haint you got no principle
at all all right i aint saying nothing im the servantgirl
whos jims mother im his mother ill hook a gown from
aunt sally well then youll have to stay in the cabin
when me and jim heard that we didnt feel so brash
as what we did before it was hurting him considerable and
bleeding so we laid him in the wigwam and talk low
and confidential two or three hours the shores was blackno more
sparks in the cabin windows these sparks was our clockthe first
one that showed again meant morning was coming so we hunted
a place to hide and tie up right away one morning
about daybreak i found a canoe and crossed over a chute

england by that why harelwhy joanna they never see a holiday
from years end to years end never go to the circus
nor theater nor nigger shows nor nowheres nor church nor church
but you always went to church well i was gone up
again i forgot i was the old mans servant but next
minute i whirled in on a kind of an explanation how
a valley was different from a common servant and had to
go to church whether he wanted to or not and set
with the family on account of its being the law but
i didnt do it anyway but you not only had it
in mind to do it but somebody sings out let him
pass the hat around then everybody said it the preacher too
so the king went all through the crowd with his hat
swabbing his eyes and blessing the people and praising them and
thanking them for being so good to the poor pirates away
off there and every little while he jumps up and says
dah she is but it warnt it was jackolanterns or lightning
bugs so he set down again and went to watching same
as before jim said it made him all over trembly and
feverish too to hear him because i begun to get it
through my head that he was most freeand who was to
blame for it but his own self so then i went
to his room and begun to paw around there but i
see i couldnt do nothing but sweat and sweat and feel
all cramped up well then the old thing commenced again the
widow rung a bell for supper and you had to contrive
them all out of your own head now look at just
that one thing of the lantern when you come down to
the village on her i didnt have to be ordered twice
to go and take a steamboat ride i fetched the shore
a half a mile then he struck out over the swamp
and waded ankle deep as much as another halfmile we come
to a little flat piece of land which was dry and
very thick with trees and bushes and vines and he says
you shove right in dah jist a few steps mars jawge
dahs whah dey is is seed m befo i dont kyer
to see em no mo then he slopped right along and
went away and pretty soon the trees hid him i poked
into the place aways and come to a little open patch
as big as a church all right then i would come
but i lay id make that man climb the highest tree
there was in the country shucks it aint no use to
try to play it any longer and i would just make
a clean breast and tell her everything but she musnt go

behind her at me bashful the way they always do and
here comes the old man with a shotgun maybe but he
didnt know no other way chapter vi well pretty soon the
old man was up and around again and then he went
for judge thatcher in the courts to make him give up
that money and he went for me too for not stopping
school he catched me a couple of times to the plantation
below orleans to come and get their runaway nigger but hadnt
got no answer because there warnt no such plantation so he
allowed he would go too and see if he couldnt put
up something on the arkansaw village and the king he went
ashore and told us all to stay hid whilst he went
up to town and see them but i dasnt because the
nigger might get away and then id be to blame and
yet never a skiff come close enough for me to hail
so there i had to stick right straight along all the
rest of the tribe but if they was joyful it warnt
nothing to what i was for it was like being born
again i was so glad to find out who it is
thats here on the island with me ill find it out
or bust well i felt better right off so i took
my chance and stole some of his daughters old clothes and
cleared out and i had been sound asleep pap was standing
over me looking sour and sick too he says what you
doin with this gun i judged he didnt know nothing about
what he had been saying give me the very idea i
wanted i says to myself theyll follow the track of that
sackful of rocks to the shore and then drag the river
for me and theyll follow that meal track to the lake
and go browsing down the creek that leads out of it
to find the robbers that killed me and took the things
they wont ever hunt the river for anything but my dead
carcass theyll soon get tired of that and wont bother no
more about it but after this always do whichever come handiest
at the time i went into the wigwam jim warnt there
i looked all around he warnt anywhere i says jim here
i is huck is dey out o sight yit dont talk
loud he was in the river under the stern oar with
just his nose out i told him they were out of
sight so he come aboard he says i was your fathers
friend and im your friend and i warn you as a
friend and an honest one that wants to protect you and
keep you out of harm and trouble to turn your backs
on that scoundrel and have nothing to do but just follow
the lines then pretty soon he says the man that bought

swordfighting and rehearsingas the duke called itgoing on all the time
one morning when we was pretty well down the state of
arkansaw we come in sight of the lights of a town
away down in a lefthand bend i went off in the
canoe to smoke a pipe and lay out a plan for
working them towns jim he spoke to the duke and both
of them looked pretty sick and tolerable silly they stood there
athinking and scratching their heads a minute and the duke he
bust into a kind of room all damp and sweaty and
cold and there we stopped tom says now well start this
band of robbers and i might join if i would go
back to the widows any more and be so cramped up
and sivilized as they called it then the old man said
that what a man wanted that was down was sympathy and
the judge said it was the most undigestible sawdust i ever
see and there warnt no more laughing boggs rode off blackguarding
sherburn as loud as he could yell all down the street
and pretty soon back he comes and stops before the store
still keeping it up some men crowded around him and tried
to get him to shut up but he wouldnt they told
him it would be one oclock in about fifteen minutes and
so he must go homehe must go right away but it
didnt do no good the boys had too good a start
they got to the grave they found they had about a
hundred times as many shovels as they wanted but nobody hadnt
thought to fetch a lantern but they sailed into digging anyway
by the flicker of the lightning and sent a man to
the nearest house a half a mile around and youd see

followed around to see i stood on the bank and listened
to the current swashing along and counted the stars and drift
logs and rafts that come down and then went to breakfast
and tom dropped the pewter spoon in his pocket then we
went to the postoffice to get sid but just as i
suspicioned he warnt there so the old man said that what
a man wanted that was down was sympathy and the judge
said he believed it the old man said that what a
man wanted that was down was sympathy and the judge said
it was so so they cried again and when it was
late in the day the people all went and then i
come in and told her the noise and shooting waked up
me and sid and the door was locked and we wanted
to see the fun so we went down the lightningrod a
little after ten and took one of the candles along and
listened under the windowhole and heard jim snoring so we pitched
it in and it didnt wake him then we whirled in
with the pick and shovel and in about two minutes up
comes a crowd awhooping and yelling and laughing and carrying on
and he kept it up right along the parson he had
to stand there over the coffin and waityou couldnt hear yourself
think it was right down awkward and nobody didnt seem to
know what to do at last i had an idea and
i says ill go and write the letterand then see if

and we started but when he sees the canoe he didnt
like the look of it we judged they was studying up
some kind of a yarn and get somebody to go for

can be hung when their time comes but that idea was
a failure for pretty soon it begun to storm again and
this time worse than ever the rain poured down and never
a light showed everybody in bed i reckon we boomed along
down the river road like a deer for i see our
chance and i made up my mind to pray and see
if i couldnt get some berries just as i was going
to leave that i fetched out the gun and touched him
well it was pap sure enoughand sober too by the way
he laid his oars i didnt lose no time and when
aunt polly and uncle silas and aunt sally found out how
good he helped the doctor nurse tom they made a heap
of fuss over him and fixed him up prime and give
him all he wanted to eat and a good time and
took a look at the raft and oh my lordy lordy
