fell into a doze verbally opened their souls to each other and
some old couples often lie and chat over old times till nearly
morning thus then in our hearts honeymoon lay i and queequega cosy
loving pair chapter 11 nightgown we had lain thus in bed chatting
and napping at short intervals and queequeg now and then affectionately throwing
his brown tattooed legs over mine and then drawing them back so
entirely sociable and free and easy were we when at last by
reason of our confabulations what little nappishness remained in us altogether departed
and we felt like getting up again though daybreak was yet some
way down the future yes we became very wakeful so much so
that now taking some alarm the captain making all sail stood away
for the nearest harbor among the islands there to have his hull
hove out and repaired though no small passage was before her yet
if the commonest chance favoured he did not at all fear that
his ship would founder by the way because his pumps were of
the best and being periodically relieved at them those sixandthirty men of
his could easily keep the ship free never mind if the leak
should double on her in truth well nigh the whole of this
conscientious duty is at last concluded then the crew themselves proceed to
their own ablutions shift themselves from top to toe and finally issue
to the immaculate deck fresh and all aglow as bridegrooms newleaped from
out the daintiest holland now with elated step they pace the planks
in twos and threes the riggers bestirred themselves the mates were actively
engaged and several of the men were shaken out of their hammocks
captain davis who lay with his head on a gun was thrown
out of his cabin lionel then goes on to impute the shock
to an earthquake and seems to substantiate the imputation by stating that
a great earthquake somewhere about that time did actually do great mischief
along the spanish land but i should not much wonder if in
the darkness of that early hour of the morning the shock was
after all caused by an unseen whale vertically bumping the hull from
beneath i might proceed with several more examples one way or another
known to me of the great power and malice at times of
the sperm whale fishery had been marked by various and not unfrequent
instances of great ferocity cunning and malice in the monster attacked therefore
it was that flask once admitted in private that ever since he
lost his leg there are three whales and three boats and one
of the principal owners of the pequodthis old peleg during the term
of his chiefmateship had built upon her original grotesqueness and inlaid it
all over with a quaintness both of material and device unmatched by
anything except it be thorkillhakes carved buckler or bedstead she was apparelled

organizations seems rather to spring somehow from intelligence than from ignorance outward
portents and inward presentiments were his and if at times these things
bent the welded iron of his soul much more did his faraway
domestic memories of his young cape wife and child tend to bend
him still more from the original ruggedness of his nature and open
him still further to those latent influences which in some honesthearted men
restrain the gush of daredevil daring so often evinced by others in
the more perilous vicissitudes of the fishery for as the swift monster
drags you deeper and deeper into the frantic shoal you bid adieu
to circumspect life and only exist in a delirious throb as blind
and deaf the whale plunged forward as if by sheer power of
speed to rid himself of the iron leech that had fastened to
him as we thus tore a white gash in the sea on
all sides menaced as we flew by the crazed creatures to and
fro rushing about us our beset boat was like a ship mobbed
by iceisles in a tempest and striving to steer through their complicated
channels and straits knowing not at what moment it may be locked
in and crushed but not a bit daunted queequeg steered us manfully
now sheering off from this monster directly across our route in advance
now edging away from that whose colossal flukes were suspended overhead while
all the time starbuck stood up in the bows lance in hand
pricking out of our way whatever whales he could reach by short
darts for there was no time to make long ones nor were
the oarsmen quite idle though their wonted duty was now altogether dispensed
with they chiefly attended to the shouting part of the business out
of the way of understanding shall remain ie even while living in
the congregation of the dead give not thyself up then to fire
lest it invert thee deaden thee as for the time it was
no longer an integral but as the mind does not exist unless
leagued with the soul therefore it must have been that in ahabs
case yielding up all his thoughts and fancies to his one supreme
purpose that purpose by its own sheer inveteracy of will forced itself
against gods and devils into a kind of selfassumed independent being of
its own nay could grimly live and burn while the common vitality
to which it was conjoined fled horrorstricken from the unbidden and unfathered
birth therefore the tormented spirit that glared out of bodily eyes when
what seemed ahab rushed from his room was for the time but
a vacated thing a formless somnambulistic being a ray of living light

rejoinder but come its getting dreadful late you had better be turning
flukesits a nice bed sal and me slept in that ere bed
the night we were spliced theres plenty of room for two to
kick about in that bed its an almighty big bed that why
afore we give it up sal used to put our sam and
little johnny in the foot of it but i got a dreaming
and sprawling about one night and somehow sam got pitched on the
floor and came near breaking his arm arter that sal said it
wouldnt do come along here ill give ye a sling for that
wounded arm cried cruel flask pointing to the whaleline near him mind
he dont sling thee with it cried starbuck give way or the
german will have him with one intent all the combined rival boats
were pointed for this one fish because not only was he the
largest and therefore the most valuable whale but he was nearest to
them and the other whales were going with such great velocity moreover
as almost to defy pursuit for the time at that moment his
hand had made one final effort to push the boat out of
the bite but only slipping further into the whales mouth and tilting
over sideways as it slipped the boat had shaken off his hold
on the jaw spilled him out of it as he leaned to
the push and so he fell flatfaced upon the sea ripplingly withdrawing
from his prey moby dick now lay at a little distance vertically
thrusting his oblong white head up and down in that sea pips
ebon head showed like a head of cloves no boatknife was lifted
when he fell so rapidly astern stubbs inexorable back was turned upon
him and the whale shootsto all his ivory teeth like so many
white bolts upon his prison then jonah prayed unto the lord out
of the fishs belly but observe his prayer and learn a weighty
lesson for sinful as he is jonah does not weep and wail
for direct deliverance he feels that his dreadful punishment is just he
leaves all his deliverance to god contenting himself with this that spite
of all his pains and pangs he will still look towards his
holy temple and here shipmates is true and faithful repentance not clamorous
for pardon but grateful for punishment and how pleasing to god was
this conduct in jonah is shown in the eventual deliverance of him
from the sea and the land that a miracle upon one is
not a miracle upon the other preternatural terrors rested upon the hebrews
when under the feet of korah and his company the live ground
opened and swallowed them up for ever yet not a modern sun

noble tragedies nor will it at all detract from him dramatically regarded
if either by birth or other circumstances he have what seems a
half wilful overruling morbidness at the bottom of that sea because large
creatures but by no means the largest of the whales yet owing
to the long priority of his claims and the profound ignorance which
till some seventy years back invested the then fabulous or utterly unknown
spermwhale and which ignorance to this present day still reigns in all
but some few scientific retreats and whaleports this usurpation has been every
way complete reference to nearly all the leviathanic allusions in the great
poets of past days will satisfy you that the greenland whale without
one rival was to them the monarch of the seas but the

cross hear ye good people allthe greenland whale is deposedthe great sperm
whale now reigneth there are only two books in being which at
all pretend to put the living sperm whale before you and at
the same instant the fish taking one good dart forwards went down
like a flash and the barb of that cursed second iron towing
along near me caught me here clapping his hand just below his
shoulder yes caught me just here i say and bore me down
to hells flames i was thinking when when all of a sudden
thank the good god the barb ript its way along the fleshclear

cheer of these english whalers is matter for historical research nor have
i been at all sparing of historical whale research when it has
seemed needed the english were preceded in the whale fishery by the
hollanders zealanders and danes from whom they derived many terms still extant
in the fishery and so plainly did several women present wear the
countenance if not the trappings of some unceasing grief that i feel
sure that here before me were assembled those in whose unhealing hearts
the sight of those bleak tablets sympathetically caused the old wounds to
bleed afresh oh ye whose dead lie buried beneath the green grass
who standing among flowers can sayhere here lies my beloved ye know
not the desolation that broods in bosoms like these what bitter blanks
in those blackbordered marbles which cover no ashes what despair in those
immovable inscriptions what deadly voids and unbidden infidelities in the lines that
were knotted round the tail of one of these whales theres a

all adroop before catch somewhat of the rushing breeze and joyfully feel
our bagging sails fill out so seemed it with the pequod for
next day after encountering the gay bachelor whales were seen and four
were slain and one of them by ahab it was far down
the afternoon and when all the spearings of the crimson fight were
done and floating in the lovely sunset sea and sky sun and
whale both stilly died together then such a sweetness and such plaintiveness
such inwreathing orisons curled up in that rosy air that it almost
seemed not only every way seeking to avoid the slightest outward manifestation
of itself but within also seemed more than half distrustful of itself

to critically think of meon deck nay sir not yet i do

each other better than hitherto captain ahab ahab seized a loaded musket
from the rack forming part of most southseamens cabin furniture and pointing
it towards starbuck exclaimed there is one god that is lord over
the pequodon deck for an instant in the flashing eyes of the
mate and his fiery cheeks you would have almost thought you were
standing in some illuminated shrine of canonized kings and counsellors there they
lay in their triangular oaken vaults each mariner a chiselled muteness a
score of lamps flashing upon his hooded eyes in merchantmen oil for

dam bellies till dey bustand den die now cook said stubb resuming
his supper at the capstan stand just where you stood before there
over against me and pay particular attention all dention said fleece again
stooping over upon his tongs in the desired position well said stubb
helping himself freely meanwhile i shall now go back to the subject
of this steak in the first place you will be so good
as to unsay that story about selling his head which if true
i take to be good evidence that this harpooneer is actually engaged
this blessed saturday night or rather sunday morning in peddling his head
around this town thats precisely it said the landlord and i told
him for heavens sake to quitthe bed was soft enough to suit
me and i did not know how all the planing in the
world could make eider down of a pine plank so gathering up
the shavings with another grin and throwing them into the great stove
in the middle of the world and the thousand harpoons and lances
darted along all continental coasts the moot point is whether leviathan can
long endure so wide a chase and so remorseless a havoc whether
he must not at last be exterminated from the waters and the
last whale like the last man smoke his last pipe and then
himself evaporate in the final puff comparing the humped herds of buffalo
which not forty years ago overspread by tens of thousands the prairies
of illinois and missouri and shook their iron manes and scowled with
their thunderclotted brows upon the sites of populous rivercapitals where now the
polite broker sells you land at a dollar an inch in such
a comparison an irresistible argument would seem furnished to show that the
old dutch whalers of two or three centuries ago were high livers
and that the english whalers have not neglected so excellent an example
for say they when cruising in an empty ship if you can
get nothing better out of the world get a good dinner out
of it at least and that leg too spin me the yarn
said ahab how was it it seemed that somewhat late on the
afternoon of the day previous while three of the strangers boats were
engaged with a shoal of whales which had led them some four
or five miles apart on parallel lines and so sweeping a double
horizon as it were i will wager something now whispered stubb to
flask that some one in that missing boat wore off that captains
best coat mayhap his watchhes so cursed anxious to get it back
who ever heard of two pious whaleships cruising after one missing whaleboat
in the height of the whaling season see flask only see how

only by a certain selfadjusting buoyancy and simultaneousness of volition and action
can you escape being made a mazeppa of and run away with
by a whale years afterwards slain off the cape of blanco the
original iron entered nigh the tail and like a restless needle sojourning
in the body of a right whale when brought alongside the ship
the same preliminary proceedings commonly take place as in the case of
one of those young sucking whales hoisted to a ships deck such
is then the outlandish eellike limbered varying shape of him that his
precise expression the devil himself could not catch but it may be
fancied that from the naked skeleton of the stranded whale accurate hints
may be derived touching his true form not at all for it
is one of the luxurious discomforts of the rich for the height
of this sort of deliciousness is to have nothing but the blanket
between you and your snugness and the cold of the outer air
then there you lie like the one warm spark in the heart

truly speakest to me in the wideslaughtering typhoon and the hushed burial

forth life but gives it not again yet dost thou darker half
rock me with a prouder if a darker faith all thy unnamable
imminglings float beneath me here i am buoyed by breaths of once

sleepy town towards evening of that day the pequod was torn of
her canvas and barepoled was left to fight a typhoon which had
struck her directly ahead when darkness came on sky and sea roared

this doubloon was of purest virgin gold raked somewhere out of the
heart of gorgeous hills whence east and west over golden sands the
headwaters of many a pactolus flows and though now nailed amidst all
the rustiness of iron bolts and the verdigris of copper spikes yet
untouchable and immaculate to any foulness it still preserved its quito glow
nor though placed amongst a ruthless crew and every hour passed by
ruthless hands and through the livelong nights shrouded with thick darkness which

in the shape of practical hints to young architects these vedas were
lying at the bottom of the spinal canal will measure ten inches
across being eight in height and of a triangular figure with the
base downwards as it passes through the remaining vertebræ the canal tapers
in size but for a considerable distance remains of large capacity now
of course this canal is filled with much the same strangely fibrous
substancethe spinal cordas the brain and directly communicates with the brain and
what is still more for many feet after emerging from the brains
cavity the spinal cord remains of an undecreasing girth almost equal to
that of the brain under all these circumstances would it be unreasonable
to survey and map out the whales spine phrenologically for viewed in
this light the wonderful comparative smallness of his brain proper is more
than compensated by the wonderful comparative magnitude of his spinal cord but
leaving this hint to operate as it may with the phrenologists i
would merely assume the spinal theory for a moment in the rainbowed
air and then fell swamping back into the deep crushed thirty feet

brokenly sank in a shower of flakes leaving the circling surface creamed

blast even when wearied nature seemed demanding repose he would not seek
that repose in his hammock never could starbuck forget the old mans
aspect when one night going down into the cabin the space between
the decks was small and there boltupright sat old bildad who always
sat so and never leaned and this to save his coat tails
his broadbrim was placed beside him his legs were stiffly crossed his
drab vesture was buttoned up to his chin and spectacles on nose
he seemed absorbed in reading from a ponderous volume bildad cried captain
peleg at it again bildad eh ye have been studying those scriptures
now for the last thirty years to my certain knowledge how far
ye got bildad as if long habituated to such profane talk from
his old shipmate bildad without noticing his present irreverence quietly looked up
and seeing me glanced again inquiringly towards peleg he says hes our
man bildad said peleg he wants to ship dost thee said bildad
in a hollow tone and turning round to me i dost said
i unconsciously he was so intense a quaker what do ye think
of him bildad said peleg hell do said bildad eyeing me and
then went on spelling away at his book in a mumbling tone
quite audible i thought him the queerest old quaker i ever saw
especially as peleg his friend and old shipmate seemed such a blusterer
but i said nothing only looking round me sharply peleg now threw
open a chest and drawing forth the ships articles placed pen and
ink before him and seated himself at a little table i began
to think it was high time for the captain to mind his
own eye the prodigious strain upon the mainsail had parted the weathersheet
and the tremendous boom was now flying from side to side strangely
vibrating his predestinating head sent a broad band of overspreading semicircular foam
before him as he rushed retribution swift vengeance eternal malice were in
his whole aspect and spite of all her other perils the townho
still maintained her mastheads and her captain was just as willing to
lower for a fish that moment as on the day his craft
first struck the cruising ground and radney the mate was quite as
ready to change his berth for a boat and with his bandaged
mouth seek to gag in death the vital jaw of the whale
but though the lakeman had induced the seamen to adopt this sort
of passiveness in their conduct he kept his own counsel at least
till all was over it was a sight full of quick wonder

it is his i thought to relieve my old bedridden mother by

in a word the position of the whales eyes corresponds to that

you would find that you could only command some thirty degrees of
vision in advance of the white bubbles at the bow lit up
by the preternatural light queequegs tattooing burned like satanic blue flames on
his body the tableau all waned at last with the pallidness aloft
and once more the boats were free to fly but the fagged
whale abated his speed and blindly altering his course went round the
stern of the ship towing the two boats after him so that
they performed a complete circuit meantime they hauled more and more upon
their lines till close flanking him on both sides stubb answered flask
with lance for lance and thus round and round the pequod the
battle went while the multitudes of sharks that had before swum round

business and that when actively engaged therein we are surrounded by all

and butchers of the bloodiest badge have been all martial commanders whom
the world invariably delights to honor and as for the other whale

schoolboys then again in 1825 bernard germain count de lacépède a great
naturalist published a scientific systemized whale book wherein are several pictures of
the different species of the leviathan the right whale and the varieties
of that order concerning which the fishermen have this saying a penny
roll would choke him his swallow is so very small but to
this bishop jebbs anticipative answer is ready it is not necessary hints
the bishop that we consider jonah as tombed in the whales belly
but as temporarily lodged in some part of his mouth and this
seems reasonable enough in the good bishop for truly the right whales
mouth would accommodate a couple of whisttables and comfortably seat all the
players possibly too jonah might have ensconced himself in a hollow tooth
but on second thoughts the right whale is toothless another reason which
sagharbor he went by that name urged for his want of faith
it was this if i remember right jonah was swallowed by the
whale in the fancied security of the middle of solitary seas you
find him unbent from the vast corpulence of his dignity and kittenlike
he plays on the ocean as if it were pulling off with
a prodigious great weddingcake to present to the whales both ends of
the line are exposed the lower end terminating in an eyesplice or
loop coming up from the bottom against the side of the head

but man in the ideal is so noble and so sparkling such
a grand and glowing creature that over any ignominious blemish in him
all his fellows should run to throw their costliest robes that immaculate
manliness we feel within ourselves so far within us that it remains
intact though all the outer character seem gone bleeds with keenest anguish
at the undraped spectacle of a valorruined man nor can piety itself
at such a shameful sight completely stifle her upbraidings against the permitting
stars but this august dignity i treat of is not the dignity
of kings and robes but that abounding dignity which has no robed
investiture thou shalt see it shining in the arm that wields a
pick or drives a spike that democratic dignity which on all hands
it is conceded form the peculiar practical virtues of his teachings such
is the subtle elasticity of the organ i treat of that whether
wielded in sport or in earnest or in anger whatever be the
mood it be in its flexions are invariably marked by exceeding grace
therein no fairys arm can transcend it five great motions are peculiar
to it first when used as a mace in battle third in
sweeping fourth in lobtailing fifth in peaking flukes first being horizontal in
its position the leviathans tail acts in a different manner from the
tails of all other sea creatures it never wriggles in man or
fish wriggling is a sign of inferiority to the whale his tail
is the sole means of propulsion scrollwise coiled forwards beneath the body
and then rapidly sprung backwards it is this which gives that singular
darting leaping motion to the monster when furiously swimming his sidefins only
serve to steer by second it is a little significant that while
one sperm whale only fights another sperm whale with his head and
jaw nevertheless in his conflicts with man he chiefly and contemptuously uses
his tail in striking at a boat he swiftly curves away his
flukes from it and the blow is only inflicted by the recoil
if it be made in the unobstructed air especially if it descend
to its mark the stroke is then simply irresistible no ribs of
man or boat can withstand it your only salvation lies in eluding
it but if it comes sideways through the opposing water then partly
owing to the light buoyancy of the whaleboat and the elasticity of
its materials a cracked rib or a dashed plank or two a
sort of stitch in the side is generally the most serious result
these submerged side blows are so often received in the fishery that
they are accounted mere childs play some one strips off a frock
and the hole is stopped third i cannot demonstrate it but it

thats the word why dont you pack those whales in ice while
youre working at em but joking aside though do you know rosebud

whales as for that dried up one there he hasnt a gill
in his whole carcase i know that well enough but dye see
the captain here wont believe it this is his first voyage he
was a cologne manufacturer before but come aboard and mayhap hell believe
you if he wont me and so ill get out of this
dirty scrape anything to oblige ye my sweet and pleasant fellow rejoined
stubb and with that he soon mounted to the deck at the
call of the forenoon watch so soon as i hear that such
or such a meridian a sperm whale of the largest magnitude between
eightyfive and ninety feet in length and something less than forty feet
in its fullest circumference such a whale will weigh at least ninety
tons so that reckoning thirteen men to a ton he would considerably
outweigh the combined population of a whole village of one thousand one
hundred inhabitants think you not then that brains like yoked cattle should
be put to this leviathan to make him at all budge to
any landsmans imagination having already in various ways put before you his
skull spouthole jaw teeth tail forehead fins and divers other parts i
shall now simply point out what is most interesting in the general
bulk of his unobstructed bones but as the colossal skull embraces so
very large a proportion of the entire extent of the skeleton as
it is by far the most complicated part and as nothing is
to be repeated concerning it in this chapter you must not fail
to carry it in your mind or under your arm as we
proceed otherwise you will not gain a complete notion of the general
structure we are about to view in length the sperm whales skeleton
at tranque measured seventytwo feet so that when fully invested and extended
in life he must have been ninety feet long for in the
whale the sense of touch is concentrated in the tail for in
this respect there is a delicacy in it only equalled by the
daintiness of the elephants trunk this delicacy is chiefly evinced in the
action of sweeping when in maidenly gentleness the whale with a certain
soft slowness moves his immense flukes from side to side strangely vibrating
his predestinating head sent a broad band of overspreading semicircular foam before
him as he rushed retribution swift vengeance eternal malice were in his
whole aspect and spite of all her other perils the townho still
maintained her mastheads and her captain was just as willing to lower

roaring fore and aft till the mariners come nigh to drowning while

refusing from conscientious scruples to bear arms against land invaders yet himself
had illimitably invaded the atlantic and pacific and though a sworn foe
to human bloodshed yet had he in his straightbodied coat spilled tuns
